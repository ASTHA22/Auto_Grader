Gist of this iteration:
Detailed output of the individual student programs can be checked using this iteration for each test case instance.
The student needs to write code in give block in student program base code.
The grading works for test cases with integer or numerical inputs and outputs.
Hence, we can check how many test cases does the program pass and fail and it's respective details.

Iteration_1 folder has following files:
1. test_cases.txt - Test cases file where last column is expected output
2. student_program.py - Program submitted by the student. Student must write their codes in the given block only
3. grading_script.py - this code runs the test cases on the student program and gives test case - pass/fail results and an overall summary. It generates a result.csv output
4. result.csv - This file is generated after running the command in the terminal. The file will contain details for each test case instances and an overall summary.
Result file will be stored in the default Jupyter folder. If you want to change it to custom path then change line 52 of 'grading_script.py' code to : csv_file = '/path/to/results.csv'
Eg: csv_file = 'Documents/results.csv'

Run the following command in Jupyter terminal:
python /path/to/grading_script.py  /path/to/student_program.py /path/to/test_cases.txt
Eg:
python /Users/asthasingh/AutoGrading_project/Iteration_1/grading_script.py /Users/asthasingh/AutoGrading_project/Iteration_1/student_program.py /Users/asthasingh/AutoGrading_project/Iteration_1/test_cases.txt
